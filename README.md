# <strong>How It's Made:</strong>
<strong>Tech used</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express

This application uses the four CRUD methods (create, read, update and delete), communicating between the client side, the database, and the server to display messages created by the user. 

# <strong>Lesson Learned:</strong>
I learned how to use passport in order to utilize user authentication.  


This application stores data on MongoDB then retrieves it in order to display it to the user. Express is used as a framework in order to simplify node.
